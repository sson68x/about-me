    <p style="background-color: lightgreen">I'm Simon Son, and I live in Seattle. I served in the U.S. Army and worked as a behavioral health specilist. After I was seperated from the army, I studied human development at UC Davis. I am currently learning software development at Code Fellows. As a software development student, I'd like to expand my knowledge in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, so that I can become a full-stack software developer one day. My hobby is playing console games. </p>
